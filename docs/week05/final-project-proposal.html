    <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The final programming task is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your mastery of the
      JavaScript language learning outcomes as presented in the course by creating a small, working
      program. Doing so will help you
    <ul>
      <li>translate simple, well defined, discipline specific algorithms to JavaScript,</li>
      <li>create functions in JavaScript from well-defined descriptions,</li>
      <li>setup and be familiar with the development environment for JavaScript so you can write
        code to solve problems, </li>
      <li>write code using JavaScript specific syntax and style, including comments, and</li>
      <li>find focused resources for how to use JavaScript syntax.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Project Idea</h3>
    <p>Consider a project on a topic or opportunity in which you have a interest. You will need to
      review the requirements in order to consider
      the <strong>functionality</strong> and <strong>scope</strong> of your project. Note that you
      will need to incorporate data from an external data source in JSON format. That will affect
      your choice of application. The target time commitment is about three (3-5) hours so that will
      affect the functional scope of the project.</p>

    <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
    <p>Your project must meet the following requirements: <a
        href="../week07/final-project-description.html">Final Project Description</a></p>

    <p>You will not need to submit any code at this point. However, as soon as you settle on an
      idea, write down the steps in as much detail as you can before you start coding. The smaller
      the steps the better. If you get the steps small enough then each step will convert into one
      or a few lines of code, and your application will become easier to create and manage.</p>

    <h3>Submission</h3>
    <p>
      Submit your programming project proposal in Canvas. Your submission will just be a
      <strong>text entry</strong>
      describing the idea and its basic features. <em>Again, you will <strong>not</strong> be
        submitting any code at this point</em>.
